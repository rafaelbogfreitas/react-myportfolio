    `Hi, I'm Rafael, a self-taught web developer eager to learn and improve.`,
    `Recently I grew to love the web and can't go one day without exercise my curiosity for it.
    I am enthusiastic about CSS preprocessors and modern technologies such as flex-box, grid, and animations.
    I have a passionate interest in learning JavaScript and the latest ES6+ specifications, as well as spending a lot of time 
    researching new libraries and frameworks. Most recently I have been studying React, however, I was trying to get back to 
    basics and understand the underlying JavaScript behind any new library or framework.`,
    `Nowadays, I have been focusing on getting better at organizing my code and making it as simple and semantic as possible,
    as my goal is to be part of a team and share my work with others.`,
    `Now I work as a floor manager in a busy London restaurant, where I have learned valuable life skills and work
    ethics. I can meet deadlines, listen and learn from criticism, adapt positively to changes and work
    well in a team.`,
    `I have always been curious by nature and like challenges and puzzles. I am into cycling and have taken on the London to Paris
    route once but didn't enjoy the destination as much as I enjoyed the ride to get there.`,
    `Here you can see what I have achieved in my short journey in web development. I hope you enjoy!`
