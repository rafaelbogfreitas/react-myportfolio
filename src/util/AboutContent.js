    `Hi, I'm Rafael, a self-taught web developer eager to learn and improve.`,
    `Recently I grew to love the web and can't go one day without exercise my curiosity about it.
    I am enthusiastic about CSS preprocessors and modern technologies as flex-box, grid and animations.
    As I have a passionate interest in JavaScript and ES6, I spend most of my energy researching it and before
    even considering to learn JS libraries or frameworks I was practicing and studying vanilla first. Most recently
    my time is spent on learning React.`,
    `Nowadays, I have been focusing on getting better at organizing my code and making it as simple and semantic as possible,
    as my goal is to be part of a team and share my work with others.`,
    `Now I work as a floor manager in a busy London restaurant, where I have learned valuable life skills and work
    ethics. I can meet up with deadlines, listen and accept critics, adapt positively to changes and work
    with a team.`,
    `I have always been curious by nature and like challenges and puzzles. I am into cycling and have taken on the London to Paris
    route once but didn't enjoy the destination as much as I enjoyed the ride to get there.`,
    `Here you can see what I have achieved in my short journey in web development. I hope you enjoy!`
